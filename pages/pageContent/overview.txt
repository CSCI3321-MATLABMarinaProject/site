<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>MATLAB Marina is a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) dedicated to 
			the improvement of student learning of programming concepts using MATLAB, 
			a technical computing language. It consists of several learning modules 
			organized under the following areas: Fundamental Programming Concepts, 
			Advanced Programming Concepts and Applications. Each learning module 
			is designed to encompass the following through relevant content items:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Reviewing fundamental algorithmic concepts and MATLAB syntax 
				through primers, list of terms, list of MATLAB commands/functions 
				and sample programs, </li>
				<li>Demonstrating balanced, dual approaches to algorithm development 
				and programming using MATLABs IDE through multimedia tutorials and
				</li>
				<li>Providing practice exercises and assessment tools.</li>
			</ol>
			The VLE is currently used as the primary resource for the following 
			course: Computing for Engineers (ENGR1371) and as a supplement for the 
			course: Computational Modeling (ENGR2010), both taught at
			<a href="http://www.armstrong.edu">Armstrong State University</a>.<br>
			<br>Please contact the Project Director
			<a href="mailto:Priya.Goeser@armstrong.edu">Dr. Priya Goeser </a>if 
			you are interested in further information, plan to use MATLAB Marina 
			actively or in other partnership opportunities.<br>
