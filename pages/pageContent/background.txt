<h1>Background</h1>
			<p>Programming is a skill that is a crucial component in all engineering 
			functions from problem solving to analysis and design. Hence, all engineering 
			curriculums include programming courses and most employers today require 
			engineers to be proficient in programming in one or more languages. 
			Most of these programming courses are designed with the following course 
			outcomes: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Students will be able to use an IDE to develop and debug programs.</li>
				<li>Students will be able to write programs for solving engineering 
				problems using fundamental programming concepts: mathematical and 
				logic expressions, conditional structures, iteration, functions 
				and arrays. </li>
				<li>Students will be able to implement programs using advanced programming 
				concepts: cell arrays, structures and recursion and perform file 
				input and output operations. </li>
				<li>Students will be able to use MATLAB (or another programming 
				language) for applications such as plotting 2-D and 3-D data, performing 
				numerical methods, and manipulating sound and images. </li>
				<li>Students will understand stacks, and searching and sorting data.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These are extensive topics that warrant a 1-2 semester course to 
			be covered in depth and detail. This VLE may be used as an effective 
			supplement for such programming courses. </p>
