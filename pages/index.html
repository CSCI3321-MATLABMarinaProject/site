<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>MATLAB Marina is a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) dedicated to the improvement 
of student learning of programming concepts using MATLAB, a technical computing 
language. It consists of several learning modules organized under the following 
areas: Fundamental Programming Concepts, Advanced Programming Concepts and Applications. 
Each learning module is designed to encompass the following through relevant content 
items: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Reviewing fundamental algorithmic concepts and MATLAB syntax through primers, 
	list of terms, list of MATLAB commands/functions and sample programs, </li>
	<li>Demonstrating balanced, dual approaches to algorithm development and programming 
	using MATLABs IDE through multimedia tutorials and </li>
	<li>Providing practice exercises and assessment tools. </li>
</ol>
The VLE is currently used as the primary resource for the following course: Computing 
for Engineers (ENGR1371) and as a supplement for the course: Computational Modeling 
(ENGR2010), both taught at <a href="http://www.armstrong.edu">Armstrong State University</a>.<br>
<br>Please contact the Project Director
<a href="mailto:Priya.Goeser@armstrong.edu">Dr. Priya Goeser </a>if you are interested 
in further information, plan to use MATLAB Marina actively or in other partnership 
opportunities.<br>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Programming is a skill that is a crucial component in all engineering functions 
from problem solving to analysis and design. Hence, all engineering curriculums 
include programming courses and most employers today require engineers to be proficient 
in programming in one or more languages. Most of these programming courses are designed 
with the following course outcomes: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Students will be able to use an IDE to develop and debug programs.</li>
	<li>Students will be able to write programs for solving engineering problems 
	using fundamental programming concepts: mathematical and logic expressions, 
	conditional structures, iteration, functions and arrays.</li>
	<li>Students will be able to implement programs using advanced programming concepts: 
	cell arrays, structures and recursion and perform file input and output operations.</li>
	<li>Students will be able to use MATLAB (or another programming language) for 
	applications such as plotting 2-D and 3-D data, performing numerical methods, 
	and manipulating sound and images.</li>
	<li>Students will understand stacks, and searching and sorting data. </li>
</ol>
These are extensive topics that warrant a 1-2 semester course to be covered in depth 
and detail. This VLE may be used as an effective supplement for such programming 
courses.
